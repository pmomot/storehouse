# This is the readme file

To run this locally, please install all npm and bower dependencies

> npm install
> bower install

then, to be able to run it in browser, you need to <br/>
1. Run node server

> node index.js

<b>But</b> if you want to write some server side logic without pain, we suggest you to have Nodemon installed globally on your system.
You can install it with this command

> npm install -g nodemon

then you can just type

>npm start

in terminal and be free of restarting server every time after changing 'foo' to 'bar'.

After this you can open http://localhost:3000/ in browser
